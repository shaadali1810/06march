    "#Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of empirical data. It is a highly interdisciplinary field that finds applicability in virtually all scientific fields.The mathematical theories behind statistics rely heavily on differential and integral calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.2 Statistics is concerned with uncertainty and variation, and it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied.1 Without rudimentary knowledge of how it works, people cannot make informed judgments and evaluations of a wide variety of things encountered in daily life.0"
